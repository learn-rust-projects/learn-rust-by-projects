# Build Your Own Git

This project is a challenge to implement a simplified version of Git from scratch. The goal is to understand Git's internal mechanics, including object storage, indexing, and commits, by building your own version step by step.

---

## Setup

This challenge is developed using [Codecrafters Course SDK](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk). Please read the SDK README for information on:

- How to contribute language support.
- How to submit your solution.

Our project is based on this SDK and includes custom test scripts to automatically verify your implementation.

---

## Testing

Run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
make test
```

This command will execute all automated tests, checking the correctness of your Git implementation, including:

Object storage (blobs, trees, commits)

Index file creation and updates

Commit objects and HEAD references
